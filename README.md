Raise an issue to join the **Coders Evoke** Community GitHub community.

### Ideas

Get your ideas in the GitHub Issue Queue!

If we could find a really good name for this, we could have a `"support"` repo in GitHub profiles, similar to the GitHub username README (n.b. to create `githubusername/githubusername` as a repo then put a README in there.

We could then have folks to have their own "support" repository and be able to PR in their contributions!

Please check out the [issue queue](https://github.com/Coders-Evoke-Community/support/issues) for sticking issues with this and we can all pair on this.
